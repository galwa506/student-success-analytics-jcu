## Data Disclaimer

All data files in this repository (within `/data/`) are synthetic and contain no real student or university records. They serve as examples to demonstrate code functionality only.

Student-success-analytics-jcu is a comprehensive analytics platform designed to predict and enhance student success and retention for JCU (not the real data). Leveraging modern data science techniques, the project integrates data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, cloud deployment (Azure ML), and powerful dashboards (Power BI) to enable early identification of at-risk students and support evidence-based interventions.

Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Utilities for preparing institutional data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Notebooks and reports analyzing trends in student performance, retention rates, and risk factors.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models to forecast student success, drop-out risk, and academic outcomes using Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.).

Cloud-based Deployment: Example scripts for serving models as APIs on Azure ML.

Business Intelligence Dashboards: Integration with Power BI for interactive data visualization and reporting for institutional stakeholders.

Reproducible Pipelines: Jupyter notebooks and modular scripts for end-to-end transparency and customization.
